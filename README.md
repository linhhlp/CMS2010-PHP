# CMS-PHP

**The project is read-only for references.**

It was my first comprehensive personal project when I started learning PHP in 2010. The program does not run properly with the newest versions of PHP as the main code was based on PHP5 and was not maintained with many **deprecated features/functions** in the newer versions of PHP. 

The idea of this project was inspired by Joomla or Drupal CMS which let people create a website without coding. Just a simple setup with a database and others information. 

The code was written in OOP (Object Oriented programming) which was quite new to PHP (which supported OOP from version 5). The website was divided into different parts such as 

* `component` which provides the main content in a web page.

* `module` or `plugin` provides additional minor features to the website.

* `template` provides a design of template/theme for the website.

The project was coded by myself in amateur coding as I started learning to program from day 1.
